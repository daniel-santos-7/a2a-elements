# A2A Elements

Analog-to-asynchronous (A2A) elements are useful components for developing [asynchronous circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_circuit). These components are important for synchronizing analog signals that represent events to be monitored by asynchronous circuits. Some A2A elements are also used for event arbitration.

A2A components are presented in detail on [this page](https://workcraft.org/a2a/start). This repository only presents the implementation of some of these elements, which can be reused in asynchronous circuit projects. All components were implemented using (Workcraft software)[https://workcraft.org/start].
